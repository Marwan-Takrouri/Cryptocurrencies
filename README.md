# Cryptocurrencies
Martha is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of your most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked me to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
Myself and Martha have done our  research. We will be using unsupervised Machine learning , We will need to demonstrate   how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. It’s time to put all these skills to use by creating an analysis for our clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.


The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. She’ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board
In unsupervised learning, there are two key differences from the above approach:
•	There are no paired inputs and outcomes.
•	The model uses a whole dataset as input.

In supervised learning, the input data already has a paired outcome, which is plugged in to train the model to predict outcomes in new datasets. 
We built  a model that, when given unfamiliar data, can accurately predict the outcomes.
